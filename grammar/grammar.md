# Grammar

The scene file must end with a .rt extension. And must use the following grammar description.
This file will be used in order to specify the whole scene to the ray tracer engine.

The comments are used as in C: // for mono line comments and /* */ for multiple line comments.

**Warning**: The scene file is case sensitive.

## Scalar definition

A scene file can have multiple value types which are.

- ID which is a unique string that will define an object. It must be only composed by alphanumeric characters or
  underscores but can't begin by a number.
- Floating point numbers can be used to describe real quantities (as object sizes or light intensity).
- Integers are used to define quantities using only natural numbers (as the frame size in the resolution).
- Tuples are a group of scalars defined by a `()`.
- Objects are a group of scalars used as a struct in C, the property names in it are also IDs and must follow the ID
  definition. An object can be named using an ID.

Objects are defined by using the following syntax:

```
object_type [object_name_id] {
	property_name = value
	//...
}
```

## File organisation

The scene file will be organized in several blocks that will define each object in the world. It also describes metadata
objects that describe how the scene is organized (cameras, light...).

### Main block

The main block describes the scene as whole and can contain the following properties.

| Name       | Required | Description            | Value type                            | Default Value |
